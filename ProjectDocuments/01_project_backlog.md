#### Problem Statement
We will add user accounts and playlist support to the existing Iguana Suite and update the iOS and web interfaces accordingly. We will add alternate interfaces such as a Chrome extension and possibly a Chromecast application. The Iguana Suite is a pre-existing suite of software developed by Alec Gorge that provides programmatic access to hundreds of artists and hundreds of thousands of songs. The Iguana Suite will be better than the existing Archive.org interface by allowing filtering and sorting of concerts.

#### Background Information
The Iguana Suite is an existing API server, simple web app and simple iOS app built by Alec Gorge. The app has over 35k installations and is used thousands of times per day and streams over 100k songs by more than 80 artists every month. People using the app (Listen to the Dead, LotusOD) and website (lotusod.com, marcoallday.com) are fans of the band or music buffs who are interested in finding new live music. Music is legally sourced from the Live Music Archive on Archive.org. Archive.org has a very poor interface and Iguana represents a significant improvement in many of those core tenents. However, the functionality is currently very basic and there is significant room for value-added features such as Chromecast integration, user accounts, fluid browsing between multiple artists, playlists and more.

There are no applications that are targeted specifically at the Live Music Archive. There are other iOS apps that act as a client to Archive.org, but they suffer from many of the same issues due to poor data organization on Archive.org. Iguana address this issue by collecting all the data in a database and then going through a process that cleans up, duplicates and categorizes the data in a way that is very useful for browsing and listening to music.
